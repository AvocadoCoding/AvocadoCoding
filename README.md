### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub repo. I'm an enthusiastic amateur programmer looking to build great applications, particularly in React.

I'm currently working on some applications as a hobby. I'm always open to potential collaborations so please get in touch if that is something you are interested in.

I also have a background in mechanical engineering, automotive engineering, systems engineering, battery technology and research.

You can connect with me on LinkedIn here: [<a href= "https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-gardner-profile/" target="blank"><img align="center" src="LinkedInIcon.svg" height="30" alt="LinkedIn Logo"/></a>](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-gardner-profile/)

Please find my pinned projects below :arrow_down_small: and Happy Coding! :smiley:
